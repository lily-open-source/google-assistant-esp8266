  <h1>Google Assistant on ESP8266</h1>
  <p>This is a simple example of how to use the Google Assistant API on an ESP8266 microcontroller.</p>
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>An ESP8266 microcontroller</li>
    <li>A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project with the Google Assistant API enabled</li>
    <li>The Arduino IDE and the Arduino ESP8266 library installed</li>
    <li>The Google Assistant Arduino library installed</li>
    <li>A JSON file with your GCP credentials</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Setup</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Follow the instructions in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/library/python/embed/setup-dev-project-python">Google Assistant API documentation</a> to set up a GCP project and enable the Google Assistant API.</li>
    <li>Create an OAuth client ID and download the JSON file containing your credentials.</li>
    <li>Install the Arduino ESP8266 library and the Google Assistant Arduino library.</li>
    <li>Connect your ESP8266 to your computer and upload the Arduino sketch to your microcontroller.</li>
    <li>Add the JSON file with your GCP credentials to your sketch and customize the code to fit your needs.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>Once the setup is complete, you can use the <code>assistant</code> object in your code to interact with the Google Assistant. For example, you can send requests and receive responses like this:</p>
  <pre>
String request = "What is the weather like today?";
String response = assistant.send(request);
Serial.println("Assistant response: " + response);
  </pre>
  <p>You can also use the <code>loop()</code> function to continuously listen for requests and handle responses in real-time. For more information, refer to the documentation of the Google Assistant Arduino library.</p>
  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  <p>If you encounter any issues while using the Google Assistant API on your ESP8266 microcontroller, make sure to check the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure that your GCP project is set up correctly and that the Google Assistant API is enabled.</li>
    <li>Make sure that you have correctly added the JSON file with your GCP credentials to your sketch.</li>
    <li>Check the serial output for any error messages or log messages that may help you debug the issue.</li>
    <li>Refer to the documentation of the Google Assistant API and the Arduino ESP8266 library for more information and guidance.</li>
  </ul>
